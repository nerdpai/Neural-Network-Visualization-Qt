# Neural-Network-Visualization-Qt
Visual representation of how the neural network works.

For demonstration I took the most trivial self-written neural network, which was tested on an open dataset. (Layers: 784, 16, 16, 10)

The program was created in qt.

The user must draw something in the left field and use the buttons to get the result of the network either immediately or after going through each layer individually in the right field.
